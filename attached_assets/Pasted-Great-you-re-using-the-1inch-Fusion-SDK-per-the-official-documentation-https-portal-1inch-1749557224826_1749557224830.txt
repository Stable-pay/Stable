Great ‚Äî you‚Äôre using the **1inch Fusion+ SDK** per the [official documentation](https://portal.1inch.dev/documentation/apis/swap/fusion-plus/fusion-plus-sdk/for-integrators/sdk-overview).

Let‚Äôs break down why your Fusion+ integration is failing and how to correctly set it up using **Fusion+ SDK**:

---

## üö´ What‚Äôs Going Wrong:

### ‚ùå Wrong API Endpoint

You're sending a POST request to:

```
/v1.0/1/quote
```

This is **not a valid Fusion+ endpoint**.

Fusion+ doesn‚Äôt have a REST API for `/quote` like legacy 1inch APIs. Instead, Fusion+ is primarily powered through their **SDK** (client-side), and it **relies on off-chain signed orders** and **relayers** ‚Äî not traditional quote endpoints.

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Integration Approach (Fusion+ SDK)

1inch Fusion+ SDK is designed for **gasless swaps** using **off-chain signed meta-transactions** that relayers later execute. Here‚Äôs the basic approach:

---

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Fix:

### 1. **Use the SDK instead of direct API calls**

Install the SDK:

```bash
npm install @1inch/fusion-sdk
```

---

### 2. **Code Sample for Getting a Quote and Signing a Fusion Order**

```ts
import { FusionSDK, NetworkEnum, PrivateKeyProviderConnector } from '@1inch/fusion-sdk';

const sdk = new FusionSDK({
  url: 'https://api.1inch.dev/fusion',
  network: NetworkEnum.ETHEREUM,
  authKey: '<your 1inch api key>',
  connector: new PrivateKeyProviderConnector('<your private key>'),
});

const order = await sdk.placeOrder({
  fromTokenAddress: '0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE', // ETH
  toTokenAddress: '0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48', // USDC on Ethereum
  amount: '10000000000000000', // 0.01 ETH in wei
  walletAddress: '<user wallet address>',
  preset: 'fast', // fast | medium | slow
});
```

---

### 3. **Ensure the Token is Valid**

Check if your token `0xa0b86a33...` is a supported token by Fusion+.

Fusion+ currently supports only **popular tokens** on **main networks (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon)** ‚Äî custom tokens may not work.

You can verify on:

```bash
https://api.1inch.dev/swap/v5.2/1/tokens
```

Use your API key in headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

---

### 4. **Auth Key Setup**

Ensure your `1inch.dev` API key is correctly set in the SDK config and also added to your project on [1inch Developer Portal](https://portal.1inch.dev/).

## ‚úÖ Summary:

| Issue                   | Fix                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hitting `/v1.0/1/quote` | ‚ùå Invalid endpoint ‚Äî Fusion+ uses SDK not direct REST calls |
| "Not valid token"       | ‚úÖ Verify token is supported in `/tokens` endpoint           |
| API 404 and 429         | ‚úÖ Use SDK with correct `authKey`, and token whitelisting    |
| Want gasless swaps      | ‚úÖ Fusion SDK signs off-chain orders for relayers            |

If you'd like, I can help you set up a **complete Fusion+ SDK implementation** in TypeScript or Node.js for your platform ‚Äî just let me know your target chain and tokens.
